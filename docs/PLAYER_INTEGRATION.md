# Player-provided lyricInfo integration

Players that already own timed lyrics do not need an in-module `PlayerAdapter` or a dependency on the module APK. Publish an OPlus-compatible JSON string under the `lyricInfo` metadata key of the active media session. The module discovers the active provider in SystemUI.

```json
{
  "songName": "Song title",
  "artist": "Artist",
  "songId": "stable-player-song-id",
  "lyric": "[00:00.00]Line one\n[00:05.20]Line two",
  "rawLyric": "[00:00.000]Line[00:00.320] [00:00.440]one[00:05.200]"
}
```

- `lyric` is required and must contain at least one timed LRC tag.
- `songName`, `artist`, and a stable `songId` should be provided.
- `rawLyric` is optional. It enables the module's word-level highlighting and layout renderer.
- Before OPlus consumes `lyric`, the module normalizes same-timestamp bilingual groups to one primary line item. Keep complete translations and word timing in `rawLyric` or a timed translation field.
- Zero-width spacer-only lines are ignored. Use real timed primary lines rather than invisible placeholders to control list position.
- A player that publishes only `lyric` still gets native OPlus line-level lyrics, dynamic provider recognition, whitelist bypass, and screen-timeout handling.
- The player does not need to be added to the module's LSPosed scope.

## Data-source priority

For a player outside the built-in compatibility-adapter scope, a valid player-provided payload is consumed directly in SystemUI. For Salt Player or ConePlayer, where the module also runs inside the player process, the priority is:

1. A player-provided enhanced payload containing timed `rawLyric` or timed translation data.
2. A timed lyric captured by the module's compatibility adapter and verified for the current track.
3. A simple player/OPlus `lyricInfo` payload containing only line-level lyrics.

This means a future line-only native `lyricInfo` implementation remains a safe fallback, while the adapter can still provide word timing and translations. Once adapter data is available, the module builds a fresh payload instead of merging fields from the simple native payload.

For Media3, place the JSON in `MediaItem.mediaMetadata.extras`. Prefer publishing the first current item with its complete `lyricInfo` already attached. For framework media sessions, use `android.media.MediaMetadata.Builder.putString("lyricInfo", json)` and call `MediaSession.setMetadata`.

Update the whole payload on each track transition, remove it when lyrics are disabled or unavailable, and keep `lyric` and `rawLyric` on the same time offset. `LyricInfoContract.java` is the canonical constants and validation reference; players do not need to link against it.

## Optional translation action

To expose the lock-screen translation toggle, publish this standard action as the first `PlaybackState` custom action:

```kotlin
private const val ACTION_TOGGLE_TRANSLATION =
    "io.github.andrealtb.lockscreenlyrics.action.TOGGLE_TRANSLATION"

val action = PlaybackState.CustomAction.Builder(
    ACTION_TOGGLE_TRANSLATION,
    "Lyric translation",
    R.drawable.any_valid_media_icon // Android requires a non-zero resource ID
).build()
```

The Android API requires a valid icon resource, but the player does not need to create a dedicated translation icon. The module first looks for `ic_translation` in the player package and otherwise uses its bundled Salt-style translation icon. Publish the action only while the current `lyricInfo` contains usable translations, and remove it on track changes or when translations are unavailable. The module enables the required OPlus custom-action slot, handles taps, and persists the toggle state. If the module is absent, Android may deliver the action to the player, which should safely ignore the no-op callback.

## Recommended publication timing

Publish on state changes instead of using a repeating timer:

1. Publish once when the media session is created or the feature is enabled, if current lyrics are ready. The initial metadata, notification, and current `MediaItem` should all describe the same track and carry the same complete `lyricInfo`.
2. Remove the previous payload as soon as a track transition begins.
3. Publish the complete payload once when the new track's asynchronous lyric load finishes. If playback has already started, update the latest current-item metadata and the session/notification metadata as one logical operation.
4. If the session or current `MediaItem` is rebuilt, read its metadata first and republish only when `lyricInfo` is missing or differs from the target JSON.
5. Do not publish a lyric-free track metadata object and then patch only `extras` a few milliseconds later. OPlus may debounce that second update (`within debounce period, ignore`), leaving the first track at `hasLyric=false` until another track change. If lyrics are not ready at track creation, wait for the initial media update burst to settle before the one complete lyric update.
6. For Media3/OPlus builds with propagation races, an optional check about `800 ms` after the first complete publication may republish at most once, and only when the value is still missing. Do not continue periodic retries.
7. Cancel pending retries and remove `lyricInfo` when the feature is disabled, lyrics are unavailable, or the queue becomes empty.

In normal operation this means **one publication per track**, or at most **two** on a system that demonstrably loses the first update. Playback position changes, pause/resume, and ordinary notification refreshes must not rewrite `lyricInfo`.

### First-track checklist

- Build `lyricInfo` from the same title, artist, and stable media ID used by the current media item.
- Attach it before the first metadata/notification publication whenever lyrics are already available.
- When lyrics arrive asynchronously, clone the latest metadata instead of an earlier snapshot, then replace the current item only once with the complete payload.
- Do not rely on an immediate extras-only update to cross the OPlus media pipeline.
- During integration testing, `hasLyric=false` after the player reports that it published `lyricInfo` usually means the update was debounced before SystemUI consumed it; it is not a lyric-format rejection by this module.
