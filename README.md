An LSPosed/libxposed API 102 module that bridges timed lyrics from supported Android music players into the ColorOS/OPlus lock-screen lyric pipeline.

The module currently ships with a default Salt Player adapter and SystemUI renderer hooks. Salt is now just one `PlayerAdapter`, not the identity of the project.

## What It Hooks

Player process:

```text
android.media.session.MediaSession#setMetadata(android.media.MediaMetadata)
```

When a supported player submits metadata without `MediaMetadata["lyricInfo"]`, the module injects an OPlus-compatible payload:

```json
{
  "songName": "...",
  "artist": "...",
  "songId": "lockscreen-lyrics-...",
  "lyric": "[00:00.00]...",
  "rawLyric": "[00:00.000]word[00:00.120]..."
}
```

SystemUI process:

- Reads `lyricInfo` from OPlus media data.
- Builds a word-level timeline from `rawLyric` when available.
- Draws inside the official lock-screen lyric `TextView.onDraw(Canvas)` path.
- Keeps fixed-height lyric items, centers short lyrics, uses a moving two-line window for long main lyrics, and keeps the active plus next line clear while farther lines remain softened.
- Keeps the screen from timing out while a supported player's lock-screen lyric UI is actively visible.

## Screen Timeout Keep-Awake

The keep-awake logic runs only in the SystemUI process. It is intentionally tied to the official OPlus lock-screen lyric UI, not to playback alone.

SystemUI hooks used by this feature:

- `android.util.Log.i(String, String)`
- `android.util.Log.println(int, String, String)`
- OPlus Seedling media playback position/state hooks
- Visible official lyric `TextView` tracking
- `ACTION_SCREEN_OFF`, `ACTION_SCREEN_ON`, and `ACTION_USER_PRESENT` broadcasts inside SystemUI

The module watches OPlus `PluginSeedling--Template` logs for supported player packages and checks fields such as:

```text
lyricUiMode=true
lockImmersiveMode: true
containerView.isShown=true
hasLyric=false
```

It holds a `SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK` only when all of these are true:

- The current package is in `PLAYER_ADAPTERS`.
- OPlus lyric UI mode is active.
- Playback is playing.
- There is lyric evidence, such as a parsed word lyric model, official lyric metadata, or a recently visible official lyric view.
- The screen is interactive and the user has not already unlocked the device.

While active, the module also pulses `PowerManager.userActivity(...)` about every 8 seconds so the system treats the lock-screen lyric view as user-visible activity. The wake lock is released on screen off, user present/unlock, playback stop, missing lyrics, unsupported package, or any condition change.

For new player adapters, screen-timeout support is usually automatic once the player package is added to both `scope.list` and `PLAYER_ADAPTERS`. If OPlus changes the `PluginSeedling--Template` log format for a device/ROM, the keep-awake detection may need a small SystemUI-side update.

## Player Adapters

Supported players are declared in `LockscreenLyricsModule.PLAYER_ADAPTERS`.

The default adapter is:

```java
new SaltPlayerAdapter()
```

To add another player:

1. Add the package name to `src/main/resources/META-INF/xposed/scope.list`.
2. Implement a new `PlayerAdapter` next to `SaltPlayerAdapter`.
3. Capture that player's real timed lyric source and call `module.cacheTimedLyric(source, rawLyric)`.
4. Add the adapter to `PLAYER_ADAPTERS`.
5. Keep `com.android.systemui` in `scope.list`; it is required for lock-screen rendering and screen-timeout keep-awake.

If a player already writes a valid OPlus `lyricInfo` metadata field by itself, the metadata hook leaves it untouched.

## Why API 102

The local `../LSP_api` folder is libxposed API `102.0.0`. This project follows its current module layout:

- Entry class extends `io.github.libxposed.api.XposedModule`
- Entry list: `src/main/resources/META-INF/xposed/java_init.list`
- Module config: `src/main/resources/META-INF/xposed/module.prop`
- Static scope: `src/main/resources/META-INF/xposed/scope.list`
- Hook API: `hook(method).setId(...).setExceptionMode(...).intercept(...)`

`libxposed-api-stubs` is compile-only and is not packaged into the APK. It exists so the project can compile without downloading `io.github.libxposed:api:102.0.0`; LSPosed provides the real API classes at runtime.

## Build

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

APK output:

```text
app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

JDK 17 or 21 is recommended. Newer unsupported JDK versions may fail during the Android `jlink` transform.

## GitHub Actions

- `Build Debug APK`: runs on pushes to `main` and pull requests when project source or build files change. The generated debug APK is uploaded as a workflow artifact.
- `Release APK`: manually triggered from the Actions page. Enter a tag such as `v0.18.32`; the workflow builds a release-signed APK and publishes it in a GitHub Release.

The manual release workflow expects these repository secrets:

- `SIGNING_KEY`: base64-encoded keystore file content.
- `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD`: keystore password.
- `KEY_ALIAS`: signing key alias.
- `KEY_PASSWORD`: signing key password.

The release APK is published as `ColorOS-Live-Lyrics-Bridge-<tag>.apk`.

Install and test with the default Salt adapter:

```powershell
adb install -r app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
adb shell am force-stop com.salt.music
```

Enable the module in LSPosed for the target player package and System UI, then reboot or restart System UI. Restart the player, play a song, then lock the screen.

Useful logs:

```powershell
adb logcat -v time -s LockscreenLyrics
adb logcat -v time | Select-String -Pattern "LockscreenLyrics|OplusMediaDataManagerEx|loadLyricInBg|Failed to parse lyric data|LyricsRecyclerView|hasLyric"
```

Expected module log:

```text
LockscreenLyrics: Hooked MediaSession#setMetadata
LockscreenLyrics: Hooked Salt Player lyric result constructors
LockscreenLyrics: Hooked SystemUI official lyric TextView draw hooks
LockscreenLyrics: Registered SystemUI screen timeout receiver
LockscreenLyrics: Cached real timed lyric from LRC_FILE, rawChars=..., oplusChars=...
LockscreenLyrics: Injected real LRC_FILE lyricInfo for title=...
LockscreenLyrics: Cached SystemUI word lyric model, lines=...
LockscreenLyrics: Lockscreen lyric UI keep-awake ON
LockscreenLyrics: Acquired screen timeout wake lock without timeout
LockscreenLyrics: Pulsed screen timeout user activity without changing lights
LockscreenLyrics: Hooked LyricsRecyclerView#setCurrentLyric, methods=...
LockscreenLyrics: LyricsRecyclerView current index=...
LockscreenLyrics: Seedling playback state=3, playing=true, storedPosition=..., computedPosition=..., speed=...
LockscreenLyrics: Custom-drew official lyric TextView at position=..., playing=true, focused=true, line=...
LockscreenLyrics: Refreshed active lyric renderer at position=..., line=...
```

If you only see `Skip lyricInfo injection because no fresh real lyric is cached`, the adapter has not captured a timed LRC result in the current process yet, or the current song only has untimed lyrics.
